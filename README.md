# Problem Statement: 
            
            The first step is to clearly define the problem statement. In this case, the goal is to develop a system that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various factors such as age, weight, family history, and lifestyle choices.

# Design Thinking Process: 
           
           Design thinking is a human-centered approach that focuses on understanding user needs and creating innovative solutions. It involves the following stages:
           - Empathize
           - Define
           - Ideate
           - Prototype
           - Test
# Phases of Development: 
           Once the design thinking process is complete, the development of the AI-based diabetes prediction system can be divided into the following phases:
           - Data Collection
           - Data Preprocessing
           - Model Selection
           - Model Training
           - Model Evaluation
           - Deployment
           -Monitoring and Maintenance

# Dataset Selection:

             The first step is to select an appropriate dataset for training the AI model. The dataset should be representative of the target population and contain relevant features that can contribute to accurate predictions. Commonly used datasets for diabetes prediction include the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Diabetes 130-US hospitals dataset.

            - Data Preprocessing
            - Feature Selection
            - Model Training


# Evaluation Metrics:

               Evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of the trained model. In the case of diabetes prediction, common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the predictions, while precision and recall focus on the positive predictions. The F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric. AUC-ROC measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances.
